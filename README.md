Sample MATLAB code to perform 1-D inversion using Non-Linear Least Squares and the
Kennett analytical solution for 1-D layered medium (used as forward modeling tool).
Since the data shown in the paper is proprietary information we only give
an example that is not related to this information but it is suitable to
illustrate how to use this code.

Dependencies
------------
- A recent MATLAB release (version >= R2017b)

- Optimization Toolbox (MATLAB)

- Signal Processing Toolbox (MATLAB)

Running the code
----------------
The main code driver is invoked as follows:

```
  $ run Inversion1D_VpNN.m
```
